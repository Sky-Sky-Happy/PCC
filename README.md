# PCCï¼šAdaptive Convolutional Network Pruning through Pixel-Level Cross-Correlation and Channel Independence for Enhanced Model Compression
This repository is dedicated to the project "Adaptive Convolutional Network Pruning through Pixel-Level Cross-Correlation and Channel Independence for Enhanced Model Compression" by Guangyao Li,  Haijian Shao, Xing Deng, and Yingtao Jiang. The project introduces an innovative approach to deep learning model optimization using a Pixel-Level Cross-Correlation (PCC) loss term for structured pruning.
# Overview
The proposed structured pruning approach based on PCC loss addresses common challenges in deep learning model optimization, such as overlooking intrinsic linear redundancy and not fully exploiting the latent capacity of the model. It enhances the formation of robust intrinsic connections among feature maps and the discernment of finer inter-pixel relationships through a data-driven loss function in the pre-training phase. Additionally, it employs a channel screening strategy based on Channel Independence (CI) to classify channels by importance and preserve adequate linear redundancy, achieving substantial compression while retaining performance.
